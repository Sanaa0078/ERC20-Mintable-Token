# ERC20-Mintable-Token
A mintable and burnable ERC-20 token built using Solidity on the Sepolia testnet.
VictorToken is a mintable and burnable ERC-20 token created using Solidity, deployed on the Sepolia Testnet using Remix, MetaMask, and OpenZeppelin.
This project is part of my hands-on learning in blockchain development.
